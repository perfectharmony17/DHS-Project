The next few years go by in the blink of an eye as you enjoy your position
as leader of the new world. It doesn't matter if people are debating the future
of automated cars or where someone's property line ends to mow the lawn, you
have the final say in everything.

It's a good thing you're a good person, otherwise your entire society would
be built on a corrupt foundation.

Seriously, though, the years pass by smoothly as everyone remains relatively 
happy. You're a good leader, and you never impose on anyone's rights,
human, lawful, and anything in between, and as a result your people love you.

Even after your death, your name lives on in memory as the person who 
changed the world for the better.
