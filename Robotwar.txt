When Leah made her first line of super strong robots, you kind of thought 
she'd be done. But, really, she was just getting started. About a week after
the first batch, she came out with an even better mass-produced model, one that
everyone was dying to get their hands on.

A month later she has another.

A month later, yet another.

People camp outside her factory door at times to make sure they geet this new
model so they can put their own modifications on and then toss their robot
into the fighting ring, hoping to score some cash. Which, coincidently enough,
would most likely be used to bet on other robots.

What started out as a Sunday pasttime has taken over the lives of the people
to the point where if you weren't at the robot rings, you were working to earn 
money to spend at the robot games. Lovely.
