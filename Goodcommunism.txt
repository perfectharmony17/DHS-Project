With hard work and a little bit of luck, you are able to create a system where
everyone does their part in the community so that everybody is treated equally.

Everyone gets to choose the top three jobs they want, provided they meet the 
educational requirements for it, and based on need you select who goes where
and who can do what. Also, for all the less-than-desirable tasks, you have
able-bodied people on a rotation system, so that everyone has to take out
the trash sometimes, but nobody is doing it for the rest of their lives.

For a long time after your death, your society flourishes, unbothered by any
form of corruption, greed, or other human vices. Quite the miracle.

Well done.
