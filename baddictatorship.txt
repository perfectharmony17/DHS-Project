You have set yourself up as the supreme leader of the world, making sure early on that everyone knows who's in 
charge and just what it means to disobey. Your people follow without question -or at least without the courage to 
speak out against you. 

The world around you changes, but only as you allow it. Every decision save for what your people should wear in the
morning is decided for them. It's your perfect utopia. 

Just, you know, not anyone else's.
