Everyone packs up and heads over to the abandoned mirror factory about ten miles from camp. You remembered
Plato man talking about it during your first weeks at camp, but word of mouth didn't quite capture just 
how... abandoned it looked. The factory itself was made with all kinds of abstract shapes, with a gorgeous
dome over the top of it all. Even in the dim moonlight, the walls of the factory seemed to glow with light,
not having lost any its beauty with time.

The rest of the town, however, looked like everyone in it suddenly abandoned ship. You have no idea what
could have happened to make people leave in such a hurry, but at least you get to profit from their 
haste.

You set people to work looting all the houses for supplies. You tell them that any supplies
*fake_choice
	#Will be brought back and put into a common circle in the factory, to be dispersed as needed.
		*set communism %+20
		Everyone brings the supplies back to the center, where you put them in a secure stockpile in the factory, where you've taken up residence. Whenever people need supplies, they come to you, and you ration them out fairly.
	#Are theirs to keep. Finder's keepers and all that.
		*set anarchy %+20
		Some people manage to find a horde of supplies for them to use, while others end up with next to nothing. But, such is life, what can you do. You're only their leader.
	#Will be brought to me. I will take what I need and disperse the rest to the populace.
		*set dictatorship %+20
		Everyone brings back a rather impressive haul. You take a generous amount of supplies: alcohol, clean sheets, a king-size mattress, plenty of surprisingly well-kept, finely-made clothes. You take what you need and then some, and give the rest out to the general populace. They have a rather measly supply for themselves, but what can they do? You are their leader, after all.
	#Will be brought back to the factory where the camp will decide as a whole who gets what and when.
		*set republic %+20
		Everyone brings the supplies back to the factory, and when you are all present, you put the distribution to a vote. Everyone agrees that it should be a need-only basis, which you will verify so as to prevent abuse. (A check which will not be necessary because everyone is fair and takes only what they need.)
*page_break
Though general supplies are covered, you now have to worry about food. Some people managed to find 
stockpiles of canned goods, but those were few and far between, and they can only last for a couple of
days at most, and that requires quite a bit of rationing.

Your people turn to you for advice. You find yourself wondering how you managed to be put in this 
position in the first place, given your only real skill is being able to recite tons of books, but that
is neither here nor there. You need to figure out how to get your people food.

*label findfood
What do you do?
*fake_choice
	#Send gatherers out to find plants and roots to eat.
		*if (intelligence > 60)
			The gatherers, per your suggestion, come back with entire plants, roots and all. You start a community garden of sorts with all the plants you've found, and people with botanical history agree to take care of the plants. You now have a renewable food source. Well done.
			*goto basicneeds
		*else
			The gatherers come back with a good bit of food to be dispersed, but having to send them out every day gets to be tedious. Eventually people get fed up and just set up a community garden, one that people can take care of and harvest enough for even the winter time. You now have a renewable food source, but it doesn't look great that you're not the one who came up with it.

		*set techy %+30
		*set tech 1
		You ask Leah, a former engineer, to take a look at the mirror factory and see if there is a way to repurpose the mirror makers to produce food. She inspects the place and finds that since the mirrors are all duplicated from the same small piece of glass, with a single grain of food, she can duplicate it as many times as needed. Unlimited food! Nice job.
	*disable_reuse #Let the people fend for themselves. I never asked to be leader.
		*set anarchy %+15
		*set badworld +1
		Maybe not, but you are still their leader, whether you like it or not. They demand to be led. Try again.
		*goto findfood
*label basicneeds
With all of their basic needs taken care of indefinitely, your people need something to do. They turn to
the mirrors in the factory for guidance. You leave the first floor of the factory open to everyone, and so
while some take a mirror home to look at -even though you are sure there are some at their own houses-
others prefer to come to the factory and stare transfixed at the mirror for prolonged amounts of time.

Plato man remarks around a campfire one night that "We should never forget to look in the mirror."

Some people take this quite to heart, going so far as to participate in rituals, in which herbs are lit
and waved in front of a mirror while people look into it. The people who don't do this get rather creeped
out. They want the mirrors taken away.

You notice a marked change in the people who do the mirror rituals. They are all much kinder and calmer to
the people around them, and just overall seem at ease with themselves. Of course, there are still those
who have not left the mirrors except to eat, drink, and otherwise tend to themselves. They concern you 
quite a bit.

What do you do about the mirrors?
*choice
	#Get rid of them completely. This new ritual thing scares me with its potential.
		*goto nocult
	#Make the mirrors prominent in our new society. The people need something to believe in.
		*goto mirrorcult
	#Move the mirrors to one spot in the camp so people can practice their rituals if they wish and avoid them if they don't. A fair compromise.
		*goto forgotten
*label nocult
You and a few selected people who are also wary of the mirror-society thing go out
one night and destroy all of the mirrors in town. The next morning, when people discover what you've done,
there is a mixed reaction. Some people commend you for your decision, others scorn you and retreat back to
their homes, and a few of the more devout people leave in a huff of rage.

Whether your choice was the right one or not, you definitely made some enemies today.

*label forgotten
You move the mirrors into one room in the bottom floor of the factory, welcoming anyone to come at anytime 
they wish to observe the mirrors and do whatever else they wish in that regard. You are commended by both
sides for your action, though the most devout supporters and fervid disprovers are rather displeased.

For the first few weeks, everything goes splendidly. Everyone who wants to go to see the mirrors does, and
the rest are allowed to live in blissful ignorance.

However, eventually people who regularly went to the mirrors gradually found they didn't really have time 
anymore, in the interest of pursuing other things. 

Soon, the mirrors are completely forgotten, and you can't help but feel that something important has been
lost because of it.

*goto techdecide
*label mirrorcult
You yourself begin to popularize the usage of mirrors by participating in the rituals with others. You find
it really does make you think about your character, as well as giving you something to focus on other
than the dismal state of the world.

With your endorsement, the mirror ritual gains quite a bit of traction, and soon the most devout followers
become something of figureheads, going around wearing thick black robes to "block out everything trivial
in life." 

The members are intense, and the figureheads soon become leaders in their own right, though you are still
the absolute leader. However, if you were to decide something against them now, they have more than
enough power to stop you if they so choose. Tread carefully.

In the weeks following the mirror debacle, Leah Davince, a former engineer, approaches you about a potential
expansion opportunity.
"So, ${name}, I've been looking at the tech in the factory and around the town, and I've found that there is
more than enough here for us to build a massive production line of... something. Pretty much anything. We
could make new parlor screens, set up a news station or whatever and spread the word that we're here if
people need us, or we could just go back to basics: air conditioning, washer and dryer, dish washer, etc.
Or..." she bites back a smile, and trails off.

"Or what?" you ask, raising an eyebrow.

"Robots!" she says. "I'm sure it'd take some time, but I'm sure I could work something out. Robotics was my 
specialty, before machines made machines for us. Just think of the possibilities!"

You [i] are [/i] thinking of the possibilities. You know Leah can only really focus on one big project at a time,
so you need to consider your options. What would you like Leah to start building?

horde of robots according to your specfications.

And what were your specifications?

		*goto_scene robotwar

Leah gets straight to work creating a huge number of TV screens that are all hooked up to a network that 
you control. The day the station goes online, it's up to you what you do with it.
