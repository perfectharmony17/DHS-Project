Once everyone is completely settled into their new lives, you slowly begin
to withdraw your leadership pull from society until there is nothing left but
a distant memory. From now on, people are left to their own devices, and as
long as everyone treats each other fairly -which they do- you do nothing to 
interfere. It's a lovely little system, one that promotes systemlessness, and 
you're proud to have been the one to create it.
