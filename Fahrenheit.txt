You wake up to the sound of people flying down the highway, blaring their horn
as they swerve between cars that aren't moving fast enough for them. You sigh.

You'd think you would've gotten used to the sound of racing cars and people 
talking about nothing after all these years, but it still feels so... empty.
Nothing seems to do it for you, except reciting books and writing them down, 
hiding them even though you're the person people hide books from now.

First thing you did when the city was fully stablized was set up a firefighting
station. Of course, its intitial purpose was to put out any potential fires, 
since the new tech you've put into the place can be a bit buggy sometimes. But
over the next few months, you started to get reports on houses containing
contraband. When you ignore them, you start receiving reports of houses
being burned down by firemen.

At first you move to stop them, thinking that's what your people wanted. But
it soon became clear that those who wanted peace over freedom far outnumbered
those that didn't.

Either you followed the majority or you lost your cushy little setup as their
leader.

The new books burned (people had started writing them down from memory, the 
fools), and the people cheered.
