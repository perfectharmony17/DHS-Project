Everybody seems to be in agreement with you, so the next day you all pack up camp and move to another,
though hopefully much improved spot in the wilderness. 

After a couple days of migrating, you stumble upon a huge lake, so clear you can see straight down to
the bottom, and more trees than you could ever hope to count in your lifetime. The place is perfect, 
and when you say so out loud, everyone agrees with their de facto leader and sets up camp again.
*page_break
However, as perfect as this new camp seems, you realize their are two things missing: shelter for the
people without tents, and food. You look up at the sky and see what look like storm clouds 
approaching -even the people with tents will get drenched in that. You look around and here people
complaining about splitting up the last of the food. There isn't enough for everyone to have even
a crumb. It's up to you to decide what to do about this.

You call for everyone's attention and announce your plan. Everyone seems to nod in agreement with it.
You ask for volunteers to lead.

Only two people raise their hands. Exactly as many as you needed, but not quite the number of options
you'd hoped for. 

Your two choices are Evangeline, a smart, resourceful girl who has always been eager to help, if a 
little on the arrogant side and Warren, a cookie-cutter buff guy who, while smart enough, lacks... 
common sense is the kindest way to put it, I suppose. He means well enough, but he once thought that
the point of [i] Animal Farm [/i] was to prove that humans weren't the only intelligent forms of life.

Not quite, buddy. Not quite.

	Everyone pitches in and looks for both food and shelter. One person stumbles across a cave big enough for everyone, and that with the plethora of food everyone brought back makes for a successful day. When the storm hits, everyone is safe, dry, and goes to bed with a full stomach. Good job.

	Everyone splits off and looks for their own food. Some people find a bunch of berries and roots and are happy, others find nothing, and a bunch of people end up eating poisonous berries and are miserable for the next few days. Shelter is even worse because though someone finds a shelter big enough for everyone, they don't really want to share it, so everyone else is stuck in their flimsy tents when the storm hits. Hardly anyone is pleased with this outcome but, you know, at least it's their fault and not yours. And, hey, eventually you get the cave owner to let everyone else in. So, there. Leadership.

You manage to find a surplus of food by combing through the forest with the rest of the campers.
You are all very pleased with your finds and are ready to find shelter.
*page_break.
Unfortunately, that's when the storm hits, and you were right in your assumption that the tents would
not be enough to stay dry from the storm. Everyone crams into the few tents you do have, but the rain 
soaks through and leaves everyone chilled to the bone by morning, and many people now have head colds.

Despite the fact that you now have plenty of food and water, all that your people will remember is
that you failed in finding them shelter. Though they are only complaining right now, you will need
to be careful in the future. If you make them too angry or unhappy, they may just decide that you
are no longer worth keeping around.

Evangeline's group comes back with plenty of berries and roots and even a hatful of honeysuckles,
enough for everyone to eat however much stew they want.

Warren's group, on the other hand, brings back a bunch of long logs and sticks as shelter.

"What on earth are we supposed to do with this, Warren?"

"Well, we could make a log cabin or something out of it? Maybe teepees. I don't know, ${name}, it's 
not like there's much out here in the middle of nowhere."

"And yet we've managed just fine before," you say, teeth clenched as you feel the first drops of
rain indicating the oncoming storm. "Everyone, get in your tents now. Anyone without a tent, join
someone else's. There's a storm coming and we're just going to have to wear it out thanks to 
Warren."

But though people are blaming Warren now as they hurry into their tents and grumble, tomorrow, when
they all wake up with headcolds after enduring a freezing, wet, and sleepless night, they'll all be
blaming you for poor leadership. 

The next morning you get up and find a huge cave to use as shelter while log cabins are being built,
but the damage is already done. Though your people are only complaining right now, you will need to 
be careful in the future. If you make them too angry or unhappy, they may just decide that you are 
no longer worth keeping around.

Evangeline manages to find shelter in a giant cave conveniently located under the mountain only 
half a mile away from the lake. The entrance is obscured by lots of brush and creepers, and you
have no doubt that Warren and his group would have missed it if they'd been assigned to shelter.

As it happens, Warren and his group reach yours with tons of berries and roots, looking rather
pleased with themselves. You guide them to the cave and turn on your lantern to inspect your
findings.

You are about to remark about what a good haul they've brought in when Evangeline says, rather
frantically, "We can't eat those! They're yew and holly berries!"

You recall a nature book you've once read that listed the side-effects of such berries, and now
that you think about it, these berries look eerily similar to the ones illustrated.

"Good eye," you say to Evangeline. "How did you even know that?"

"My grandfather used to be a botanist," she said.

You shrug. "Well, half of this is useless then. Go out and find more-" And then you hear the 
thunder. And see a bright light streak across the sky. "Well, guess we'll have to make do with the 
roots. I assume those are okay?"

Evangeline nods, and so you start dispersing the food. There isn't enough for everyone to get
a full meal, but you do what you can. Everyone goes to bed warm and safe from the storm, but all
they will remember are their empty, growling stomachs. 

The next morning, with Evangeline's help, you find plenty of nonpoisonous berries and fruit, but
the damage is done. Though your people are only complaining right now, you will need to 
be careful in the future. If you make them too angry or unhappy, they may just decide that you are 
no longer worth keeping around.

You ignore the raised hands of the volunteers and say, "Isaac, would you be the leader for food

Isaac you know to be a smart fellow, if a bit off-putting, and have no doubt he would be a good
leader if he would only say "yes." Which he does, much to your surprise. As does Agatha, and her
rather astonishing ability of observation has you all moving your camp to a very well-hidden, large
cave within half an hour. And Isaac's group brings back plenty of food for everyone. Everyone
goes to bed safe from the storm outside, with full stomachs and happy thoughts. Well done.

You lead people around looking for shelter first. You manage to find shelter in a large cave
just as the rain starts coming down outside. After everyone gathers their things and store them
safely inside the cave, there is not enough time to go out and get food. 

Everyone goes to sleep with empty stomachs, and despite the fact that you kept them safe from the
storm outside, they couldn't care less with how loud their stomachs are grumbling. 
Though your people are only complaining right now, you will need to

After the storm, you realize that you need to get a fire going pronto. The cave is fairly warm on its
own, but you'll need a fire outside for cooking and extra warmth. However, the forest is completely
soaked from the storm last night. Starting a fire won't be quite as easy as it usually is, and no 
one else seems to be in the mood to fix it themselves. Looks like it's up to you.

You look around and find an old man with bifocals on, and ask if you can borrow his glasses for a 
bit. You gather up all the kindling you can find, trying to find the driest pieces you can.

After a few minutes of positioning the glasses to capture the sun, you see a bit of smoke rising
from the leaves. A few more minutes, and you have flame, albeit a small one. Nevertheless, it's a
growing fire, and you're rather impressed with yourself.

"Does anyone have a pig?" the Plato man asks as he emerges from the cave.

"Unfortunately, we're all out of two-sided spears at the moment," you say.

A few people laugh heartily at that, while the others who have no idea what's funny laugh along with
them. It's a pleasant moment, but the joke raises a legitimate question.

"Do you think we should go out hunting for meat, ${name}?"

			You refuse to let a few jerks make you look like an idiot. You're their leader, for goodness' sake! So you think for a minute when an idea strikes you.

Had you known, you could have saved yourself quite a bit of time and humiliation. The group mocking you laughs even harder.
