You answer to a council of elected officials who all make decisions with their
people in mind. During every election without an incumbent member, you make sure 
all the candidates have integrity, are kind, honest and all the things that
should be present in person with a position of power, or you make sure there's 
no chance they'll ever see a public office. 

Working together with the council is a breeze, because you all essentially want
the same thing: whatever's best for the people. You all manage to get along, and
even when you disagree with each other, every respects the other's viewpoint.

Well done.
