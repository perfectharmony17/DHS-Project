The world of technology opened infinite possibilities for the shaping of your
community, so it's no wonder you made it such an integral part of everyone's 
lives. From the TVs fitted with microphone systems to massive camera grid
that can see literally every corner of your city. 

Nothing gets past you, not even a thought, and it helps to have people big and
small around to make sure nobody falls through the cracks.

Of course, some people think that with you controlling every aspect of the 
city, you are going a bit too far into the realm of totalitarianism. But to 
that you say, "2+2=5"

Anyone who argues with that is just asking to be sent to your brand-spanking-new
Room 101. 

Anyone who even thinks there's something wrong with that [i]will[/i] be sent
to the brand-spanking-new Room 101.

After all, you're Big Brother now. And everyone loves Big Brother. Or they will.
